hi bitzel here

[DOWNLOAD HERE](https://github.com/Bitzel/Mine-Imator-Enchant-Glint/releases/download/minecraft/MI_Enchants.zip)

__how to use this:__

**ITEMS:**
1. Drag the item sheet you want to use into Mine-Imator

2.   Select the "Item sheet" image-type and click OK

3.   Change to 8 Rows, 16 Columns. Click OK

4.   Open the workbench. Click item. In the drop-down list, select the item sheet.
Create.

5.   Select the item. Under "Item" on the right, enable custom item slot.

6.   Select the first image in the sequence for your first keyframe. Make sure the
keyframe is linear.

7.   Move to the 256th frame and select the last image in the sequence. The enchant
glint should now be working. Loop as needed :)

**ARMOR:**
1.   Navigate to the 'Armor' folder. Drag the desired '.miobject' into Mine-Imator.

2.   Steve is now in your project. You can change his Skin and model under 'library'
in project properties, or parent the desired armor pieces to another character.
They will look weirdly scaled. That's just how they're supposed to look. 
It's how they look in game. Type "glint" into timeline search to loop keyframes as
needed : )
